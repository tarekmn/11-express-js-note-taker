# 11 Express.js: Note Taker						
## Description
A client has reached out to me about building a note taker application that can be used to save and write notes. As a developer, I have several ways I can approach this project, so I decided on using Express.js back end. From there, it will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Lastly, I will deploy it on railway.app.
